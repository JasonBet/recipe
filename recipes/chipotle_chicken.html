    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>This copycat Chipotle chicken will make you wonder why you've
        been spending so much on takeout for subpar flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 can of chipotle in adobo (only use between 1-3 chipotle peppers
            depending on desired spiciness.
        </li>
        <li>2-4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon high smoke point cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the chipotle in adobo peppers, adobo sauce, seasonings
            and cooking oil into a blender to create marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Combine chicken thighs into a sealed bag with the marinade
            (mix well) and set in fridge for 2-12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat airfryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs into airfryer basket (be sure to 
            keep chicken thighs spaced apart and allow excess marinade to 
            drip into the sealed bag).
        </li>
        <li>Airfry chicken thighs for 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Flip chicken thighs and airfryer again for 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Inspect chicken for doneness (an instant-read thermometer 
            should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken rest 
            for 10 minutes before cutting and enjoying.
        </li>
    </ol>
