    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a simple yet incredible lasagna recipe inspired by authentic Italian lasagna from 
        Bologna.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 pounds of minced meat. 1 pound 85-90% beef, 1 pound of your choice (beef, veal, 
            pork)
        </li>
        <li>24oz tomato passata</li>
        <li>2 table spoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 white or yellow onion</li>
        <li>2-3 large loose carrots</li>
        <li>3 celery sticks</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 bunch of basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 table spoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>several table spoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>Cheeses of your choice (parmigiano regiano, mozzarella, ricotta, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop all vegetables and blend in a food processor (blend for a shorter 
            time if you want small chunks of vegetables, blend for longer if you want the 
            vegetables to nearly disappear into the sauce) to create our sofrito.
        </li>
        <li>Saute the blended sofrito in extra virgin olive oil and add 1 tablespoon of salt.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes, add minced meat and mash into small pieces using a ground 
            meat masher/chopper.</li>
        <li>Once meat is mostly cooked (about 20% pink) and tomato paste and seasonings (mash 
            very thoroughly for small crumbly meat sauce).
        </li>
        <li>Add tomato passata and mix well. Lower heat to a simmer and occasionally stir 
            every 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Add 2 large pinches of salt to the water and add lasagna noodles (ensure the boiling 
            water covers the noodles completely).
        </li>
        <li>Boil the lasagna noodles per the instructions on the packaging</li>
        <li>To assemble, add a very thin layer of the meat sauce to a baking dish.
            Then add a layer of lasagna noodles and heaping spoonfools of meat sauce. Add cheese 
            as desired.
        </li>
        <li>Once assembled, broil the dish to melt the cheese and create a golden crispy top 
            layer of melted cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
